Bug fixes, performance improvements, code formatting, docs, ... There are a lot ways in which you can contribute code. The issues list of a project is usually a great place to find something that you can help us with. You can also filter out relevant issues that might be of interest to you using the tags that are assigned to each of them.

* You satisfy our contribution criteria. In case a project has additional / a slightly different set of criterias, please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file under the relevant project's repository (if any).
* Your code follows the project's coding guidelines (if any).
* Your commit messages follow the [Semantic Commit Message](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) rules
